 GIfTI - a MATLAB GIfTI Library (v2.0)
 =====================================
 
 https://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/gifti/

 This MATLAB class allows to handle GIfTI Geometry file format from the 
 Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative.
   * GIfTI: https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti/
   * NIfTI: https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/

 It relies on external libraries:
   * [yxml](https://dev.yorhel.nl/yxml), by Yoran Heling
   * [Base64](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37109258), by polfosol
   * [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz), by Rich Geldreich
   * [mVTK](https://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/mvtk/), by Guillaume Flandin
   * [JSONio](https://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/jsonio/), by Guillaume Flandin

 Note that these tools are already included in the GIfTI library provided
 here, so you don't need to install them separately.

 There are import facilities from [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FileFormats),
 [VTK](https://vtk.org/), [Wavefront OBJ](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file),
 [Stanford PLY](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_%28file_format%29),
 [STL](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29) and
 [MZ3](https://github.com/neurolabusc/surf-ice/tree/master/mz3) file formats.

 There are export facilities to [VTK](https://vtk.org/),
 [Collada](https://www.khronos.org/collada/),
 [IDTF](http://www.meshlab.net/),
 [Wavefront OBJ](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) and
 [JS/JSON](https://plot.ly/javascript/) file formats.

 This library is also part of [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).

 INSTALLATION
 ------------
 
 MATLAB 7.1 (R14SP3) or above is required to use most of the features of
 this toolbox. GNU Octave is also supported.
 
 This library takes advantage of MATLAB Object-Oriented facilities and all
 the code is embedded in a `@gifti` class. To install it, all you need is to 
 make sure that the directory containing `@gifti` is in MATLAB path:
 
```matlab
  addpath /home/login/Documents/MATLAB/gifti
```
 
 The library relies on a number of C-MEX files (`zstream`, `base64`, `xml_parser`).
 Compiled versions for 64 bit MATLAB on Windows, Linux and Mac are provided
 but they can easily be compiled by yourself otherwise, see `@gifti/private/Makefile`.
  
 TUTORIAL
 --------
 
 In the following, we use the files contained in `BV_GIFTI.tar.gz`
 (BrainVISA examples), available from the [NITRC website](https://www.nitrc.org/frs/?group_id=75&release_id=123): 
   
```matlab
   % Read the GIfTI surface file
   g = gifti('sujet01_Lwhite.surf.gii')
    
   % Read the GIfTI shape file
   gg = gifti('sujet01_Lwhite.shape.gii')
   
   % Display mesh
   figure; plot(g);
   % Display mesh with curvature
   figure; plot(g,gg);
```
   
 In a similar way, a gifti object can be created from scratch and saved to a file:
   
 ```matlab
   load mri
   D = squeeze(D);
   Ds = smooth3(D);
   g = gifti(isosurface(Ds,5))
   
   h = plot(g);
   daspect([1,1,.4]); view(45,30); axis tight
   lightangle(45,30);
   set(h,'SpecularColorReflectance',0,'SpecularExponent',50)
    
   save(g,'mri.surf.gii','Base64Binary');
```
